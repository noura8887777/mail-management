Web-Based Mail Management Application

This project was developed as part of my web development training at ISTA Hay Al Adarissa, Fez, during an internship at the Faculty of Sciences Dhar El Mehraz (FSDM). The goal of the project was to design a web application for managing incoming and outgoing mail, addressing a critical need to digitize administrative processes.

The application replaces a manual system with a centralized, secure, and optimized solution for tracking correspondence efficiently. To achieve this, I implemented a full-stack architecture using React.js for the front-end and Laravel for the back-end.

This experience strengthened my technical skills while fostering a methodical problem-solving approach. It also improved my ability to work on strategic projects and adapt to the operational needs of an academic institution.
